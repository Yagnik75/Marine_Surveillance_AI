# Marine_Surveillance_AI

BlueSentinnel AI is a an AI agent that can do marine surveillance using live satellite image data. 
An integrated AI-powered system for **ocean monitoring** using satellite imagery.  
It detects:
- 🚢 **Illegal ships** in restricted maritime zones or Illegal Fishing vessels.
- 🛢️ **Oil spills**
- 🗑️ **Marine debris** (floating garbage)

Our current prototype uses .tif files of images and detects the above things, then finally sends alerts to the concerned authorities.
This project falls under the SDG 14 (Life Below Water) and SDG 13 (Climate
Action). 
The system combines **remote sensing**, **deep learning**, and **geospatial analysis** with **Pushbullet alerts** for real-time notifications.
